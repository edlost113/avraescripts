As long as you have adequate spices and flavorings you can make enjoyable meals out of magically created sustenance. You can prepare a meal for the entire crew in 30 minutes. If you do 1 hour of preparation the next 3 meals you make within 24 hours only take 5 minutes to prepare. A creature that spends at least 10 minutes doing nothing but eating and enjoying a meal you prepared regains 1d10 hitpoints. A creature can only gain this benefit from your food once a day."
